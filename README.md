**A brief tutorial on SQL with Python (using SQLite)**

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build a simple contacts application, since we're all familiar with it. Hopefully it will show you how to build larger databases and perform general analytics and data management with them.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to work directly with the Jupyter Notebook, you can clone this repository, download the zip, or simply download `Workshop.ipynb`. Once you have it, you can run Jupyter notebook as follows:

    $ jupyter notebook Workshop.ipynb

Note if you don't have Jupyter, you can pip install it:

    $ pip install jupyter

Otherwise, you can simply create a Python file in your local directory and add the code from the notebook as you work through it.
